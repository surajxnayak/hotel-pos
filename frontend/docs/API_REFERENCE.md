# RestaurantPos Backend API Reference

Base URL (local dev): `http://localhost:8080`
WebSocket endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/ws` (SockJS + STOMP)

> **CORS note**: the backend allows requests only from `http://localhost:3000` (both REST and the `/ws` WebSocket endpoint). The frontend **must** run on exactly `http://localhost:3000` — a different port (e.g. Vite's default `:5173`) will be blocked by the browser. If you need a different port, that's a one-line change in the backend's `SecurityConfig`/`WebSocketConfig`, not something fixable from the frontend.

## Authentication model

- **Customers**: a lightweight phone-number-only login (no password, no OTP) — `POST /api/customers/login`. This returns a `customerToken` that **must** be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <customerToken>` on the two session-entry endpoints (`create`/`join`) — it's a one-time gate to start/join a table's order list, not something needed on every subsequent request. Once you have a `sessionToken` from create/join, all cart/order endpoints work exactly as before with no customer token needed. The customer token is long-lived (30 days) — log in once, cache it, reuse it on the next visit rather than logging in every time. `POST /api/customers/logout` actually revokes the token server-side (not just a client-side "forget it") — useful on a shared device, or before logging in as a different number. Logging in again with the same or a different number afterward is unaffected; only that specific old token stops working.
- **Resuming a session** (e.g. app was closed, tab lost, page reloaded): after login, call `GET /api/customers/me/session` — if the phone number is a currently-present participant of an active session anywhere (host or joiner, doesn't matter), you get that session back directly, no PIN needed. Skip the whole create/join flow in that case and go straight to the order screen.
- **One active session per phone number**: a phone number can only be a currently-present participant of one session at a time, anywhere in the restaurant. `create`/`join` both 409 if the phone number is already active elsewhere. `POST /api/customers/me/session/leave` removes the phone number from its current session (and only that — the session itself, other participants, and the cart are untouched) so it's free to start or join somewhere else.
- **The session creator can't abandon an in-progress order**: if the phone number that *created* the session (not a joiner — joiners can always leave freely) tries to leave while any order in that session is at `PLACED` or later (submitted but not yet paid/cancelled), `leave` 409s with a message explaining why. This is deliberate — someone has to stay accountable for a table with food already in motion. Once every order in the session is either not-yet-submitted (`CART`), `CANCELLED`, or the bill has been generated (order rows are deleted at that point), the creator is free to leave like anyone else.
- **Auto-close on an empty, order-free table**: after any `leave` call, if the session's participant roster has hit zero (everyone, including the creator, has left) *and* there's no order at `PLACED` or later, the session closes and the table frees automatically — no cashier action needed. This mainly matters for a table that was created and then abandoned before anything was actually ordered. There's no dedicated notification for this — poll `GET /api/customers/me/session` (404→204 transition) or `GET /api/sessions/status/{qrToken}` to notice it happened.
- **Staff** (waiter/kitchen/cashier/admin): JWT bearer tokens obtained via `POST /api/auth/login`. Send as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every staff-role request.
- **Admin can also operate as waiter, kitchen, or cashier**: an `ADMIN` token is authorized on `/api/waiter/**`, `/api/kitchen/**`, and `/api/cashier/**`/`/api/bills/**` in addition to `/api/admin/**`. Every action taken this way is attributed to the admin's own staff account (`confirmedBy`, `changedBy`, etc.), exactly as if that role's own staff member had done it themselves. No separate admin-flavored versions of those endpoints exist — reuse them as-is.
- **Admin security PIN**: separate from the login password, only relevant for `ADMIN` accounts, gates two sensitive actions (`free-session`, `reveal-participants` — see the Admin section below). A fresh admin account (including seeded `admin1`) has no PIN set — those two endpoints 409 with "Set your security PIN first" until `PATCH /api/admin/me/pin` is called. The PIN is re-checked on every single sensitive call (sent in that call's own request body) — there's no elevated "unlocked" session state to manage on the frontend.
- **Walk-in tables opened by a waiter**: a waiter can open a table's order list directly (`POST /api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/session`) for a customer who never touches their phone at all — no customer login involved. This is entirely transparent to the customer-facing app: if that table's customer *does* eventually scan the QR code, `GET /api/sessions/status/{qrToken}` still reports `activeSessionExists: false` and `POST /api/sessions/create/{qrToken}` still behaves like a normal create — under the hood it silently attaches that customer to the session the waiter already opened (same `sessionToken`, same PIN) instead of starting a fresh one, so the customer immediately sees whatever the waiter already entered via `GET /api/sessions/{sessionToken}/orders`. No frontend changes needed for this — it's a backend-only behavior, mentioned here so it's not surprising if `create` ever returns order history that "shouldn't" exist yet. Once a session's been claimed this way, everything (join, leave, creator-lock, etc.) behaves exactly like any other customer-created session.

## Enums (exact values, case-sensitive)

```
OrderStatus:         CART, PLACED, CONFIRMED, PREPARING, READY, SERVED, BILL_REQUESTED, PAID, CANCELLED
ItemStatus:          PENDING, CONFIRMED, PREPARING, READY, SERVED, CANCELLED
PaymentMethod:       CASH, CARD, UPI, OTHER
StaffRole:           WAITER, KITCHEN, CASHIER, ADMIN
TableOverviewStatus: AVAILABLE, AWAITING_ORDER, NEEDS_CONFIRMATION, PREPARING, READY_TO_SERVE, SERVED_AWAITING_BILL, BILL_REQUESTED
DietaryType:         VEG, NON_VEG, EGG
CustomizationType:   RADIO, CHECKBOX
```

`OrderStatus.CART` is the shared draft basket before submission — it never appears in any staff-facing list (waiter/kitchen queries only ever return `PLACED`/`CONFIRMED`/etc.).

---

## Shared response shapes

### `OrderResponse` (returned by cart AND order endpoints — a cart is just an order with status `CART`)
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "tableSessionId": 1,
  "tableNumber": "T1",
  "status": "PLACED",
  "placedAt": "2026-07-06T20:24:42.474607Z",
  "items": [ /* OrderItemResponse[] */ ]
}
```
`placedAt` is `null` while `status` is `CART` (not yet actually placed).

### `OrderItemResponse`
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "menuItemId": 1,
  "menuItemName": "Paneer Tikka",
  "quantity": 2,
  "unitPrice": 345.00,
  "notes": "less spicy per customer request",
  "itemStatus": "PENDING",
  "selectedOptions": [
    { "groupName": "Portion Size", "optionName": "Large", "priceDelta": 80.00 },
    { "groupName": "Add-ons", "optionName": "Extra Cheese", "priceDelta": 30.00 }
  ]
}
```
An item with `itemStatus: "CANCELLED"` stays in the list (soft-removed, e.g. by a waiter) — the UI should show it struck-through / labeled "removed", not hide it. `notes` is **staff-only, full stop** — customers can neither write it (removed from the cart/item-update payloads) nor read it. Every customer-facing endpoint and WebSocket broadcast (`GET /api/cart/{sessionToken}`, `GET /api/sessions/{sessionToken}/orders`, `GET /api/orders/{orderId}`, `/topic/table/{sessionId}`, `/topic/cart/{sessionId}`) always returns `notes: null` regardless of what staff set it to — only staff-facing views/broadcasts (`/topic/waiter`, `/topic/kitchen`, and every waiter/kitchen/cashier/admin table-detail/queue endpoint) show the real value. Set via `PATCH /api/waiter/order-items/{itemId}/note` below. `selectedOptions` is `[]` for an item with no customization selections (most items, unless the admin has configured customization groups for that menu item) — `unitPrice` already has every selection's `priceDelta` baked in, it's a single ready-to-multiply-by-quantity number, no client-side math needed.

### `BillResponse`
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "tableSessionId": 1,
  "tableNumber": "T1",
  "subtotal": 660.00,
  "tax": 33.00,
  "discount": 0.00,
  "tip": 20.00,
  "tipRecipientName": "Waiter One",
  "total": 713.00,
  "paymentMethod": "CARD",
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-06T20:25:00.676478Z",
  "paidAt": "2026-07-06T20:25:00.841549Z",
  "voidedAt": null,
  "voidReason": null,
  "items": [
    { "menuItemName": "Paneer Tikka", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 220.00, "lineTotal": 440.00, "customizationSummary": "Large, Extra Cheese" },
    { "menuItemName": "Masala Chai", "quantity": 3, "unitPrice": 60.00, "lineTotal": 180.00, "customizationSummary": null }
  ],
  "payments": [
    { "paymentMethod": "CARD", "amount": 713.00 }
  ]
}
```
`items` is a permanent itemized snapshot taken at generate time (name/qty/price as they were at that moment) — this is the full, self-contained receipt. It does **not** live-reference the original order, so it stays correct even though the underlying order data is deleted right after generation (see the `generate` endpoint note below). `customizationSummary` is `null` when the item had no customization selections, otherwise a flat display string (e.g. `"Large, Extra Cheese"`) — it's for display only, not structured data. `tip`/`tipRecipientName` are decided at **generate** time now, not at payment time (see the `generate` row below) — `tip` is `0` and `tipRecipientName` is `null` unless the cashier supplied them when generating; `total` already includes the tip, no separate math needed. Payment (`pay`/`pay-split`) never touches tip fields, only `paymentMethod`/`payments`. `payments` is always populated once the bill is paid (one entry for a normal single-method payment, multiple for a split payment — see `pay-split` below) and `[]` before that. `voidedAt`/`voidReason` are both `null` unless the bill's been voided (see `void` below) — a voided bill keeps every other field exactly as it was at payment time, for audit; nothing is erased or recalculated.

### `BillRequestSummary`
```json
{
  "tableSessionId": 1,
  "tableNumber": "T1",
  "orders": [ /* OrderResponse[], each with status "BILL_REQUESTED" */ ]
}
```
`paymentMethod` and `paidAt` are `null` until the bill is actually paid.

### `SessionResponse` (returned by create, join, and `/api/customers/me/session` — identical shape, PIN always included)
```json
{ "sessionId": 1, "sessionToken": "91b65937-...", "tableNumber": "T1", "pin": "0163", "qrToken": "a91c92e8-..." }
```

### `SessionStatusResponse`
```json
{ "tableNumber": "T1", "activeSessionExists": false }
```

### `MenuCategoryResponse` / `MenuItemResponse`
```json
{
  "id": 1, "name": "Starters",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1, "name": "Paneer Tikka", "description": "Grilled cottage cheese skewers",
      "price": 220.00, "imageUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../paneer-tikka.jpg", "available": true,
      "dietaryType": "VEG", "allergens": "dairy",
      "customizationGroups": [
        {
          "id": 1, "name": "Portion Size", "type": "RADIO", "required": true,
          "options": [
            { "id": 1, "name": "Small", "priceDelta": 0.00 },
            { "id": 2, "name": "Medium", "priceDelta": 40.00 },
            { "id": 3, "name": "Large", "priceDelta": 80.00 }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": 2, "name": "Add-ons", "type": "CHECKBOX", "required": false,
          "options": [
            { "id": 4, "name": "Extra Cheese", "priceDelta": 30.00 },
            { "id": 5, "name": "Extra Sauce", "priceDelta": 15.00 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
`imageUrl` is a plain Cloudinary URL (or `null` if not set yet) — just use it directly as an `<img src>`, no special handling needed. Render a placeholder/fallback image client-side when it's `null`. `dietaryType` and `allergens` are both nullable — a `null` `dietaryType` just means it hasn't been tagged yet, don't assume `NON_VEG`. `allergens` is a free-text string (e.g. `"nuts, dairy"`), not a structured list. `customizationGroups` is `[]` for most items (only present when the admin has actually configured groups for that item) — see the "Selecting customizations at order time" note below for how to submit a selection.

**Selecting customizations at order time**: when adding an item with `customizationGroups` to the cart (or when a waiter places a walk-in order — same request shape both places), pass the chosen option ids as a flat list in `selectedOptionIds`, e.g. `[3, 4]` for Large + Extra Cheese. Every `required: true` group on that item must have exactly one selection from it (409 if missing); a `RADIO` group (required or not) can have at most one selection from it (409 if two are sent); `CHECKBOX` groups accept any number, including zero. `unitPrice` in the response already reflects the base price plus every selected `priceDelta` — no client-side price math needed. Selections are fixed at add-time, same as `unitPrice` already is — there's no "change the size of an already-added item," only remove it and add it again with different selections.

### `LoginResponse` (staff)
```json
{ "token": "eyJ...", "name": "Waiter One", "role": "WAITER" }
```

### `CustomerLoginResponse`
```json
{ "customerToken": "eyJ...", "customerId": 1, "phoneNumber": "9876543210" }
```

### `TableSummaryResponse` (the table-grid list view — same shape for waiter and cashier, one tile per table)
```json
{
  "tableId": 1,
  "tableNumber": "T1",
  "tableStatus": "OCCUPIED",
  "overviewStatus": "NEEDS_CONFIRMATION",
  "sessionId": 1,
  "openedAt": "2026-07-08T11:11:11.637435Z",
  "participantCount": 2,
  "ordersAwaitingConfirmation": 1,
  "itemsInKitchen": 0,
  "itemsReadyToServe": 0,
  "billRequested": false
}
```
`overviewStatus` is a server-computed priority summary of "what does this table need right now" — use it to color/badge the tile, don't try to infer urgency from the raw counts yourself. Priority order (first match wins): `NEEDS_CONFIRMATION` (an order is `PLACED`, waiting on a waiter — most urgent) → `READY_TO_SERVE` (an item is `READY`, food's getting cold) → `BILL_REQUESTED` → `PREPARING` (kitchen has it, nothing for staff to do) → `AWAITING_ORDER` (session open, nothing submitted yet) → `SERVED_AWAITING_BILL` (everything served, no bill requested yet) → `AVAILABLE` (no active session — every session-dependent field above is `null`).

### `WaiterTableDetailResponse` (waiter's drill-down for one table)
```json
{
  "tableId": 1, "tableNumber": "T1", "tableStatus": "OCCUPIED", "overviewStatus": "NEEDS_CONFIRMATION",
  "sessionId": 1, "pin": "0233", "openedAt": "2026-07-08T11:11:11.637435Z",
  "participantCount": 1, "billRequested": false, "note": "anniversary table",
  "orders": [ /* OrderResponse[], every submitted order for this session — same shape as GET /api/sessions/{sessionToken}/orders */ ]
}
```
`orders` carries real `orderId`/`itemId` values — use them to call the *existing* confirm/serve/edit endpoints directly from this view (e.g. tap an item in the drill-down → `PATCH /api/waiter/order-items/{itemId}/serve`). This is read-only additive access, not a new write surface. `note` is `null` unless a waiter has set one via `PATCH /api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/note` (see below) — a free-text annotation on the session, not tied to any item.

### `CashierTableDetailResponse` (cashier's drill-down — same itemized order detail as the waiter's, still no `pin`, still no participant phone numbers)
```json
{
  "tableId": 1, "tableNumber": "T1", "tableStatus": "OCCUPIED", "overviewStatus": "BILL_REQUESTED",
  "sessionId": 1, "openedAt": "2026-07-08T11:11:11.637435Z",
  "participantCount": 1, "billRequested": true,
  "orderCount": 1, "estimatedTotal": 220.00, "note": "anniversary table",
  "orders": [ /* OrderResponse[], identical shape/content to WaiterTableDetailResponse.orders */ ]
}
```
`estimatedTotal` is a pre-tax subtotal across all non-cancelled items in the session (tax/discount aren't known until `generate` is actually called) — show it as "~₹220 (before tax)", not as a final total. `orders` carries the same real item-level detail the waiter sees (names, quantities, statuses) — the only things still withheld from the cashier are the session `pin` and participant phone numbers/names (`participantCount` stays headcount-only). `note` is read-only here — only the waiter endpoint can set it.

### `KitchenTableDetailResponse` (kitchen's drill-down — same shape as waiter's minus `pin`)
```json
{
  "tableId": 1, "tableNumber": "T1", "tableStatus": "OCCUPIED", "overviewStatus": "PREPARING",
  "sessionId": 1, "openedAt": "2026-07-08T11:11:11.637435Z",
  "participantCount": 1, "billRequested": false, "note": "anniversary table",
  "orders": [ /* OrderResponse[] */ ]
}
```

### `ApiErrorResponse` (shape of every non-2xx response body)
```json
{ "timestamp": "2026-07-06T19:08:47.079645300Z", "status": 404, "message": "No table found for this QR code" }
```
Always parse and surface `message` on error — don't swallow it.

## REST Endpoints

### Customer login

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/customers/login` | `{ "phoneNumber": "9876543210" }` | `CustomerLoginResponse` | Find-or-create — same endpoint whether it's a new or returning number. `phoneNumber` must match `^[6-9]\d{9}$` (10-digit Indian mobile). No OTP, no verification — whatever's typed is trusted. |
| POST | `/api/customers/logout` | `Authorization: Bearer <customerToken>` header, no body | 200 empty body | Revokes that specific token server-side — it stops working immediately, everywhere, even before its 30-day expiry. 401 if the header's missing or the token's already invalid/revoked. Call this before letting a different phone number log in on the same device |
| GET | `/api/customers/me/session` | `Authorization: Bearer <customerToken>` header, no body | `SessionResponse` or empty | **200** + `SessionResponse` if this phone number is currently active in a session anywhere (host or joiner). **204** empty body if not — fall through to the normal QR → status → create/join flow. 401 if the token's missing/invalid/expired/revoked. Call this right after login to decide whether to skip straight to the order screen |
| POST | `/api/customers/me/session/leave` | `Authorization: Bearer <customerToken>` header, no body | 200 empty body | Removes this phone number from its current session's participant roster — frees it to `create`/`join` elsewhere. Does **not** affect the session itself, other participants, or the cart; they keep going. 409 if this phone number isn't currently active in any session. 409 if this phone number is the session's **creator** and any order in the session is at `PLACED` or later — see the note above. May trigger auto-close (see above) as a side effect if the roster hits zero and nothing's in flight |

### Public — Customer-facing

| Method | Path | Auth | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/menu` | none | — | `MenuCategoryResponse[]` | Full menu grouped by category |
| GET | `/api/sessions/status/{qrToken}` | none | — | `SessionStatusResponse` | Check before showing Create vs Join |
| POST | `/api/sessions/create/{qrToken}` | **`Bearer <customerToken>` required** | — | `SessionResponse` | 401 if the header is missing/invalid/expired; 409 if an order list is already active for this table; 409 if this phone number is already an active participant of a *different* session anywhere (see `/api/customers/me/session/leave`) |
| POST | `/api/sessions/join/{qrToken}` | **`Bearer <customerToken>` required** | `{ "pin": "1234" }` | `SessionResponse` | 401 if the header is missing/invalid/expired; 404 (generic "invalid PIN or no active list") on wrong PIN or no active session; 409 if this phone number is already an active participant of a *different* session. Re-joining a session you're already (or were previously) part of always succeeds, never 409s |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{sessionToken}/orders` | none | — | `OrderResponse[]` | Every **submitted** order for this session (all statuses except the current open `CART` draft — use `/api/cart/{sessionToken}` for that), oldest first. Call this on load/join/reconnect to hydrate a device's full order history in one shot — don't rely on having seen every WS event live, e.g. a new device joining mid-session, or a device that lost local state |
| GET | `/api/sessions/{sessionToken}/bill` | none | — | `BillResponse` | The session's own receipt — works whether the bill's been paid yet or not, and after the session's closed. 404 if no bill has been generated for this session yet (still eating, or nothing billed at all) |
| GET | `/api/cart/{sessionToken}` | none | — | `OrderResponse` (status `CART`) | The shared, live cart. Read-only, always works regardless of bill-request state |
| POST | `/api/cart/{sessionToken}/items` | none | `{ "menuItemId": 1, "quantity": 2, "selectedOptionIds": [3, 4] }` | `OrderResponse` | `selectedOptionIds` is optional (omit or send `[]` for an item with no customization groups) — see the customization note above `MenuItemResponse` for the selection rules. There is **no** `notes` field here anymore — customers can no longer attach a note to an item; that's staff-only now (`PATCH /api/waiter/order-items/{itemId}/note`). 409 "bill already requested" — see note below |
| PATCH | `/api/cart/{sessionToken}/items/{itemId}` | none | `{ "quantity": 3 }` | `OrderResponse` | Quantity only — optional, only send it if it changed. `quantity <= 0` deletes the item from the cart instead of setting it (same effect as `DELETE`). No `notes` field here either, same reasoning as above. 409 "bill already requested" — see note below |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/{sessionToken}/items/{itemId}` | none | — | `OrderResponse` | Removes from cart entirely (cart items are hard-removed, unlike waiter removals on placed orders). 409 "bill already requested" — see note below |
| POST | `/api/cart/{sessionToken}/submit` | none | — | `OrderResponse` (now status `PLACED`) | 409 if cart is empty. A fresh empty cart is opened automatically for the same session. 409 "bill already requested" — see note below |
| GET | `/api/orders/{orderId}` | none | — | `OrderResponse` | Poll a specific submitted order. 404 once the session's bill has been generated — the order row is deleted at that point, `BillResponse.items` (from `/api/bills/pending` etc.) is the permanent record from then on. Read-only, always works regardless of bill-request state |
| POST | `/api/orders/bill-request/{sessionToken}` | none | — | 200 empty body | 409 "The bill has already been requested for this table" if it already has been (distinct message from the "must be served" 409 below — don't conflate them). 409 "All orders must be served before requesting the bill" if any order is still in progress. Cancelled items/orders never block this — a fully-cancelled order, or an order with some cancelled items among otherwise-served ones, is treated as nothing-left-to-wait-on |

**Bill-requested lockout**: once any order in a session reaches `BILL_REQUESTED`, every *mutating* customer endpoint for that session (`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` on `/api/cart/**`, and `/api/orders/bill-request/**` again) 409s with `"The bill has already been requested for this table — no further changes are allowed"` (or the equivalent message on the bill-request endpoint itself) — no adding items, no editing, no starting a new round, no re-requesting. Read-only endpoints (`GET /api/cart/**`, `GET /api/orders/**`) are unaffected. This lifts automatically — no separate flag to manage — the moment a cashier calls `PATCH /api/bills/{sessionId}/revert` (order goes back to `SERVED`) or generates the bill.

### Auth

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | `{ "username": "waiter1", "password": "password123" }` | `LoginResponse` |

### Waiter (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, role `WAITER`)

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/waiter/tables` | — | `TableSummaryResponse[]` | The full table grid, one tile per table (including tables with no active session — `overviewStatus: "AVAILABLE"`, every session field `null`). This is the new table-overview page's main list |
| GET | `/api/waiter/tables/{tableId}` | — | `WaiterTableDetailResponse` | Drill-down for one table — full order/item detail. `{tableId}` is the numeric table id, not `tableNumber` |
| POST | `/api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/request-bill` | — | 200 empty body | Same effect as the customer's `POST /api/orders/bill-request/{sessionToken}`, just keyed by `tableId` (the waiter doesn't have the customer's `sessionToken`). Same 409s apply ("already requested" / "must be served first") |
| POST | `/api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/session` | — | `SessionResponse` | Opens a fresh order list for a table with no active session — for walk-in customers who never touch a phone. Same shape as a customer's create/join response (`sessionId`/`sessionToken`/`pin`/`qrToken`). 409 if the table already has an active session. See the walk-in note in Authentication model above — if the table's customer later scans the QR, `create` transparently attaches them to *this same* session instead of conflicting with it |
| POST | `/api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/orders` | `{ "items": [ { "menuItemId": 1, "quantity": 2, "selectedOptionIds": [3] } ] }` | `OrderResponse` | The waiter entering a verbal/walk-in order directly. One call places a whole round — `items` is a list, same per-item shape as `POST /api/cart/{sessionToken}/items` (including the same `selectedOptionIds` customization rules — a waiter walk-in order is validated exactly the same way a customer's cart-add is). Unlike the customer cart flow, this **skips `CART`/`PLACED`/confirm entirely**: the returned order is already `status: "CONFIRMED"` with every item `itemStatus: "CONFIRMED"`, and it's already visible to the kitchen — no separate confirm call needed, ever, for orders placed this way. 404 if the table has no active session (open one first via the endpoint above). 409 if the bill's already been requested for this table (same lockout as the customer cart). 404/409 per item if a `menuItemId` doesn't exist / isn't available, or if a customization selection is invalid |
| PATCH | `/api/waiter/tables/{tableId}/note` | `{ "note": "..." }` | 200 empty body | Sets/clears a free-text note on the table's active session (e.g. "anniversary table") — not tied to any item. Shows up in the `note` field of the waiter/cashier/kitchen/admin table-detail responses. Customer-facing endpoints never expose or accept this |
| GET | `/api/waiter/orders/pending` | — | `OrderResponse[]` | Orders with status `PLACED`, awaiting confirmation |
| GET | `/api/waiter/orders/ready-to-serve` | — | `OrderResponse[]` | Orders with status `READY` |
| PATCH | `/api/waiter/orders/{orderId}/confirm` | — | `OrderResponse` | `PLACED` → `CONFIRMED`, sends to kitchen |
| PATCH | `/api/waiter/order-items/{itemId}/serve` | — | `OrderResponse` | Marks one item `SERVED` |
| PATCH | `/api/waiter/order-items/{itemId}/note` | `{ "note": "..." }` | `OrderResponse` | Sets/clears the item's `notes` field — the **only** way it's ever set now (customers can't write it). Works at any item status, not just before confirming, e.g. "customer changed their mind about spice level" after the item's already `PREPARING` |
| DELETE | `/api/waiter/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}` | — | `OrderResponse` | Soft-removes an item (→ `CANCELLED`, stays visible) — **only while the order is still `PLACED`** (before confirming), 409 otherwise |
| PATCH | `/api/waiter/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}` | `{ "quantity": 3 }` | `OrderResponse` | Adjust quantity — **only while `PLACED`**, 409 otherwise. `quantity <= 0` soft-removes the item (same effect as the `DELETE` endpoint — `itemStatus` → `CANCELLED`, stays visible) instead of erroring |

### Kitchen (role `KITCHEN`)

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/kitchen/tables` | — | `TableSummaryResponse[]` | Same table grid as waiter/cashier/admin — the kitchen's own table-overview page |
| GET | `/api/kitchen/tables/{tableId}` | — | `KitchenTableDetailResponse` | Drill-down for one table — itemized orders (same shape as the waiter's), so kitchen can see everything on that table's plate at a glance. Deliberately **no** `pin` (kitchen doesn't manage session/participant access) and **no** billing fields (`estimatedTotal`/`orderCount` — cashier/admin concern). `{tableId}` is the numeric table id, not `tableNumber` |
| GET | `/api/kitchen/queue` | — | `OrderResponse[]` | Orders with status `CONFIRMED` or `PREPARING` |
| PATCH | `/api/kitchen/order-items/{itemId}/status` | `{ "itemStatus": "PREPARING" }` or `{ "itemStatus": "READY" }` | `OrderResponse` | Kitchen may only set these two statuses. Same endpoint whether the `itemId` came from the flat queue above or from the table detail view — it's one write surface, reachable two ways |

### Cashier (role `CASHIER`)

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/cashier/tables` | — | `TableSummaryResponse[]` | Same table grid as the waiter's, identical shape — the cashier's overview page main list |
| GET | `/api/cashier/tables/{tableId}` | — | `CashierTableDetailResponse` | Drill-down for one table — itemized orders + running subtotal, same order detail the waiter sees. Still **no** `pin`, still **no** participant phone numbers (`participantCount` stays headcount-only). `{tableId}` is the numeric table id, not `tableNumber` |
| GET | `/api/bills/requested` | — | `BillRequestSummary[]` | Sessions that have asked for the bill (order status `BILL_REQUESTED`) but don't have a generated `Bill` yet — this is the queue to work from before calling `generate` |
| PATCH | `/api/bills/{sessionId}/revert` | — | 200 empty body | Undoes a bill request: every `BILL_REQUESTED` order in that session goes back to `SERVED` (the only state it could have come from). For "customer pressed the button by mistake" or "wants to add one more item" — the cart is independent of billing state, so a new round can just be added normally afterward. 409 if nothing is pending for that session. Pushes the reverted order(s) to `/topic/table/{sessionId}` same as any other status change |
| GET | `/api/bills/pending` | — | `BillResponse[]` | Bills that have been generated but not yet paid |
| GET | `/api/bills/waiters` | — | `StaffOptionResponse[]` (`{ "id": 1, "name": "Waiter One" }`) | Active `WAITER`-role staff only — populate the tip-recipient dropdown on the generate-bill screen with this |
| POST | `/api/bills/{sessionId}/generate` | `{ "taxRatePercent": 5, "discount": 0, "tip"?: 20, "tipRecipientStaffId"?: 1 }` (`taxRatePercent`/`discount` **required**, `tip`/`tipRecipientStaffId` optional) | `BillResponse` | `{sessionId}` here is the numeric `sessionId`, not `sessionToken`. 400 if `taxRatePercent`/`discount` are missing/null. **The tip is decided here, at generate time — not at payment time.** `tip` omitted/`null` defaults to `0`; `total = subtotal + tax - discount + tip`. `tipRecipientStaffId` is optional and independent of `tip` (you can tip with no named recipient, or — less usefully — name a recipient with no tip); if given, 404s as "No active waiter found with id X" unless it resolves to an **active** staff account with role `WAITER` — pick the id from `GET /api/bills/waiters` above, don't let the cashier free-type it. **Works from any state where every order is `SERVED` or later** — you do **not** need to call bill-request first: if the session isn't already `BILL_REQUESTED`, `generate` transitions it there automatically before generating, in one call (still validates every order is actually `SERVED` — 409 "All orders must be served before requesting the bill" if not). This is the cashier's "generate directly" shortcut from the table-overview page — internally it's still request-then-generate, just not two separate clicks. **One-shot and final**: this call snapshots every item onto the bill (see `BillResponse.items` above), then permanently deletes the session's order/item data — there is nothing left to recompute from, so calling `generate` again for the same session 409s ("already generated"). Whether the table frees up **now** or only once paid is a server-side config toggle (`app.billing.free-table-on-generate`) — check with whoever's running the backend which mode is active |
| PATCH | `/api/bills/{billId}/pay` | `{ "paymentMethod": "CARD" }` | `BillResponse` | Records payment for the whole bill via one method. **No `tip` field here anymore** — tip was already locked in at `generate` time (see above) and this call never touches `tip`/`tipRecipientName`/`total`. If the table wasn't already freed at generate time, this is where the session closes and the table becomes `AVAILABLE` |
| PATCH | `/api/bills/{billId}/pay-split` | `{ "payments": [{ "paymentMethod": "CASH", "amount": 157.00 }, { "paymentMethod": "CARD", "amount": 200.00 }] }` | `BillResponse` | Same effect as `pay`, but across multiple payment methods at once. **No `tip` field here either**, same reasoning. `amount`s must add up **exactly** to the bill's total (which already includes any tip from generate time) — 409 naming the expected vs. given sum if they don't. On success `paymentMethod` on the bill itself is set to `OTHER` (there's no single representative method for a split payment) — use the `payments` array on `BillResponse` for the real breakdown |
| PATCH | `/api/bills/{billId}/void` | `{ "reason": "..." }` | `BillResponse` | Reverses a mistaken payment — a **full void**, not a partial refund; there's no refund-amount ledger. 409 if the bill hasn't been paid yet, or has already been voided. Doesn't touch `subtotal`/`tax`/`discount`/`tip`/`total` (the historical charge stays intact for audit) and doesn't reopen the session or un-free the table — this is a payment-record correction, not an undo of the meal. A voided bill never reappears in `GET /api/bills/pending` (it was already excluded once paid) |

### Admin (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, role `ADMIN`)

Admin also has full access to every Waiter and Cashier endpoint above (see the note in Authentication model) — not repeated here.

**PIN-gating rule**: every admin write action below requires the security PIN (`pin` in the request body), **except** `PATCH /api/admin/menu/items/{id}/availability` — the one deliberate exemption, since toggling an item on/off is frequent, low-risk, and fully reversible. Everything else — creating, editing, deleting, or bulk-changing status on staff/menu/tables — needs it. Create/delete/bulk-status-change actions accept a **list** and a single `pin` covers the whole batch, specifically so bulk work (adding 10 menu items, retiring 3 tables) doesn't mean re-entering the PIN 10 times. Detail edits (rename one table, change one staff member's role, edit one item's price) stay single-item calls, still PIN-gated per call. Every batch action is **atomic all-or-nothing** — if any entry in the list fails validation, nothing in that call is written, and the error names every offending entry, not just the first one hit.

**Self-service:**

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/me` | — | `AdminMeResponse` — `{ staffId, name, username, role, pinSet }` | `pinSet` tells the frontend whether to show "Set PIN" or "Change PIN" |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/me/pin` | `{ "currentPassword": "...", "newPin": "1234" }` | 200 empty body | Sets or changes the admin's security PIN. `newPin` must be 4–6 digits. 401 if `currentPassword` is wrong |

**Table overview + audit:**

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/tables` | — | `TableSummaryResponse[]` | Same grid as waiter/cashier |
| GET | `/api/admin/tables/{tableId}` | — | `AdminTableDetailResponse` | Superset drill-down: `pin` + itemized `orders` + `estimatedTotal` + `note`, everything waiter and cashier separately see, in one response. Still headcount-only for participants — see `reveal-participants` below to go further |
| POST | `/api/admin/tables/{tableId}/free-session` | `{ "pin": "1234" }` | 200 empty body | **PIN-gated override.** Force-closes the table's active session and frees the table regardless of order/participant state — the escape hatch for a genuinely stuck table. Does **not** touch order rows or generate a bill; whatever existed stays in the DB, still linked to the now-`CLOSED` session, visible afterward via `/api/admin/bills`/order history. 409 if no PIN is set yet, 401 on wrong PIN, 404 if no active session |
| POST | `/api/admin/tables/{tableId}/reveal-participants` | `{ "pin": "1234" }` | `ParticipantResponse[]` — `{ customerId, phoneNumber, joinedAt, leftAt, isCreator }` | **PIN-gated.** The only way phone numbers are ever exposed — the normal `GET /api/admin/tables/{tableId}` above never includes them. Re-checks the PIN every single call, no caching. Includes everyone who's ever been part of the session, including those who've left |
| GET | `/api/admin/orders/{orderId}/history` | — | `OrderStatusEventResponse[]` — `{ orderId, fromStatus, toStatus, changedByName, changedAt }` | The audit trail for one order. Works even after the order's been deleted post-billing |
| GET | `/api/admin/bills?from=&to=` | — | `BillResponse[]` | Full bill history, not just pending — `from`/`to` optional ISO instants, omitted means all-time |

**Table management:**

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/tables/roster` | — | `TableManagementResponse[]` — `{ id, tableNumber, qrToken, status, retired }` | **All** tables including retired ones — this is the only place `qrToken` is exposed to staff (for printing/regenerating QR codes) |
| POST | `/api/admin/tables` | `{ pin, tables: [{ tableNumber }, ...] }` | `TableManagementResponse[]` | Adds one or many tables in one PIN-gated call, auto-generates each `qrToken` |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/tables/{tableId}` | `{ pin, tableNumber }` | `TableManagementResponse` | **Rename only** — retiring/reactivating moved to the two bulk endpoints below |
| POST | `/api/admin/tables/retire` | `{ pin, tableIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk-retire. 409 (whole batch rejected) if any listed table has a currently-active session — free it first. Retiring is always soft (never a hard delete — `TableSession` has a permanent FK to the table) |
| POST | `/api/admin/tables/reactivate` | `{ pin, tableIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk-reactivate — the reverse of retire |

**Staff accounts:**

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/staff` | — | `StaffResponse[]` — `{ id, name, username, role, active, email, contactNumber, address }` | Never includes password/PIN hashes. `email`/`contactNumber`/`address` shown here can come either from admin at creation time or from the staff member editing their own profile later (see `/api/staff/me` below) — admin can only set them at creation, not edit them afterward |
| POST | `/api/admin/staff` | `{ pin, staff: [{ name, username, password, role, email?, contactNumber?, address? }, ...] }` | `StaffResponse[]` | Create one or many accounts in one PIN-gated call. `email`/`contactNumber`/`address` are optional per entry — admin can fill them in up front or leave them for the staff member to add later via `/api/staff/me`. 409 (whole batch rejected) if any `username` is already taken **or** repeated within the same batch — usernames must be checked against each other, not just the DB, since two new hires in the same call could otherwise collide. `password` is a **default/initial** password only — each new hire is expected to change it themselves via `/api/staff/me/password` once they log in. Admin has no way to set someone else's password after account creation — see below |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/staff/{staffId}` | `{ pin, role? }` | `StaffResponse` | Single-account edit — **`role` only**. Admin cannot edit a staff member's name, username, or contact details after creation — all of that is self-service only, via `/api/staff/me`. Also **not** `active` (moved to the two bulk endpoints below) or password |
| POST | `/api/admin/staff/activate` | `{ pin, staffIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk-reactivate — login unblocks immediately for everyone listed |
| POST | `/api/admin/staff/deactivate` | `{ pin, staffIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk-deactivate — login blocks immediately (already-wired via `StaffUserDetails.isEnabled()`). 409 (whole batch rejected) if the acting admin's own id is anywhere in the list — remove it and resubmit |

Deactivation is always soft — there's no delete endpoint for staff. `OrderStatusEvent.changedBy` and `CustomerOrder.confirmedBy` are real FKs to `StaffUser`, so a staff row can never be safely hard-deleted once it's been involved in any order.

**Password resets are no longer an admin action.** Admin sets a default password only at account creation (above); after that, only the staff member themselves can change their own password, via `/api/staff/me/password` below. There's no "admin resets someone else's password" endpoint at all — if someone's genuinely locked out, an admin has to create a fresh account or the person needs a different recovery path outside this API.

### My Account (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, **any staff role** — waiter/kitchen/cashier/admin alike)

Every staff member, regardless of role, manages their own profile and password here — this is not admin-only.

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/staff/me` | — | `StaffAccountResponse` — `{ staffId, name, username, role, email, contactNumber, address }` | The logged-in staff member's own profile |
| PATCH | `/api/staff/me` | `{ name?, username?, email?, contactNumber?, address? }` | `StaffAccountResponse` | Partial update — only send changed fields. `name` and `username` both 409 if sent blank; `username` also 409s if another account already has it (same uniqueness check as admin creating a new account). `email`/`contactNumber`/`address` are always optional and can be cleared by sending an empty string. Changing `username` changes what to sign in with going forward — the current token stays valid, but the next login must use the new value |
| PATCH | `/api/staff/me/password` | `{ "currentPassword": "...", "newPassword": "..." }` | 200 empty body | Self-service password change — always requires proving the current password first. 401 if `currentPassword` is wrong. This is the **only** way any staff account's password ever changes after creation |

**Menu management:**

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/menu/categories` | — | `AdminMenuCategoryResponse[]` — `{ id, name, sortOrder }` | All categories, unlike the public `/api/menu` which only shows available items |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/categories` | `{ pin, categories: [{ name, sortOrder? }, ...] }` | `AdminMenuCategoryResponse[]` | Create one or many categories in one PIN-gated call |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/menu/categories/{id}` | `{ pin, name?, sortOrder? }` | `AdminMenuCategoryResponse` | Single-category rename/reorder — always PIN-gated, no exemption for categories |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/categories/delete` | `{ pin, categoryIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk delete. 409 (whole batch rejected) if **any** listed category still has items — names every blocked category, not just the first, so you know exactly what to fix before retrying. Never cascade-deletes |
| GET | `/api/admin/menu/items` | — | `AdminMenuItemResponse[]` — `{ id, categoryId, categoryName, name, description, price, imageUrl, available, dietaryType, allergens, customizationGroups }` | All items, including unavailable ones. `customizationGroups` is the same shape as the public menu's (see `MenuItemResponse` above) |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/items` | `{ pin, items: [{ categoryId, name, description?, price, imageUrl?, available?, dietaryType?, allergens? }, ...] }` | `AdminMenuItemResponse[]` | Create one or many items in one PIN-gated call. `available` defaults to `true` per item; `dietaryType`/`allergens` are both optional |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/menu/items/{id}` | `{ pin, categoryId?, name?, description?, price?, imageUrl?, dietaryType?, allergens? }` | `AdminMenuItemResponse` | Single-item detail edit — always PIN-gated. **Does not touch `available`** — use the dedicated endpoint below for that |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/menu/items/{id}/availability` | `{ "available": true\|false }` | `AdminMenuItemResponse` | **The one PIN-free admin write action** — toggling an item on/off is frequent, low-risk, and fully reversible, so it's split into its own endpoint specifically so it never needs the PIN, regardless of what else you're doing |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/items/delete` | `{ pin, itemIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk delete. 409 (whole batch rejected) if **any** listed item is part of an in-progress order — names every blocked item; mark those unavailable instead via the endpoint above. Past bills are never affected either way (`BillLineItem` is a permanent name/price snapshot, no FK to `MenuItem`) |

**Menu item customization** (portion size / add-ons, Swiggy-style) — all PIN-gated, all batch-create/delete following the same conventions as everything else in this section:

| Method | Path | Body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/items/{itemId}/customization-groups` | `{ pin, groups: [{ name, type, required, options: [{ name, priceDelta }, ...] }, ...] }` | `CustomizationGroupResponse[]` — `{ id, name, type, required, options: [{ id, name, priceDelta }, ...] }` | Create one or many groups for one item in a single call, each with its initial options. `type` is `RADIO` or `CHECKBOX`; `required` only really matters for `RADIO` groups (a required `CHECKBOX` group is unusual but not blocked) |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/menu/customization-groups/{groupId}` | `{ pin, name?, type?, required? }` | `CustomizationGroupResponse` | Single-group edit |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/customization-groups/delete` | `{ pin, groupIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk delete — cascades to the group's options. No "in use" guard needed (unlike deleting a menu item/category): past orders keep a permanent snapshot of what was selected (`OrderItemResponse.selectedOptions`, `BillLineItem.customizationSummary`), so deleting the live group never rewrites history |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/customization-groups/{groupId}/options` | `{ pin, options: [{ name, priceDelta }, ...] }` | `CustomizationOptionResponse[]` — `{ id, name, priceDelta }` | Add one or many options to an existing group |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/menu/customization-options/{optionId}` | `{ pin, name?, priceDelta? }` | `CustomizationOptionResponse` | Single-option edit |
| POST | `/api/admin/menu/customization-options/delete` | `{ pin, optionIds: [...] }` | 200 empty body | Bulk delete, same no-guard reasoning as group deletion above |

**Analytics:** all three take optional `from`/`to` (ISO instant) query params, defaulting to all-time when omitted.

| Method | Path | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/analytics/revenue?from=&to=` | `RevenueSummaryResponse` — `{ from, to, totalRevenue, totalTax, totalDiscount, billCount, averageBillValue, dailyBreakdown: [{ date, revenue, billCount }] }` | Sourced from `Bill` rows, which are never deleted — always complete |
| GET | `/api/admin/analytics/top-items?from=&to=&limit=10` | `TopMenuItemResponse[]` — `{ menuItemName, quantitySold, revenue }` | Sorted by `quantitySold` descending, aggregated from bill line items |
| GET | `/api/admin/analytics/timing?from=&to=` | `OperationalTimingResponse` — `{ from, to, averageTimeToConfirmSeconds, averageTimeToServeSeconds, ordersSampled }` | Average `PLACED`→`CONFIRMED` and `CONFIRMED`→`SERVED` durations, computed from `OrderStatusEvent` — includes orders still in flight, not just billed ones. Either average field is `null` if no matching order pairs exist in range |

## WebSocket (STOMP over SockJS)

Connect: `new SockJS('http://localhost:8080/ws')` wrapped in a STOMP client (e.g. `@stomp/stompjs`). No authentication needed to connect — this endpoint is fully public.

| Topic | Payload | Who subscribes | When it fires |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/topic/waiter` | `OrderResponse` | Waiter dashboard | A new order is submitted (`CART`→`PLACED`) |
| `/topic/kitchen` | `OrderResponse` | Kitchen display | An order becomes `CONFIRMED`/`PREPARING`/`READY` |
| `/topic/cashier` | `CashierNotice` — `{ event: "BILL_REQUESTED"\|"BILL_REQUEST_REVERTED"\|"BILL_GENERATED"\|"BILL_PAID", tableSessionId, tableNumber, bill: BillResponse\|null }` | Cashier dashboard | Bill requested / reverted / generated / paid. `bill` is only non-null for the generated/paid events |
| `/topic/table/{sessionId}` | `OrderResponse` | Customer app (this specific session) | Any status change on one of this session's orders — waiter confirms, kitchen progresses, waiter edits a still-`PLACED` order, cashier reverts a bill request. Stops firing once the bill is generated (nothing left to push status updates about) — the frontend should treat this as the natural end of a visit, not a dropped connection |
| `/topic/cart/{sessionId}` | `OrderResponse` (status `CART`) | Customer app (this specific session) | Any participant adds/edits/removes a cart item, or a fresh cart opens after submit |
| `/topic/tables` | `TableSummaryResponse` | Waiter/kitchen/cashier/admin table-overview page | **One table's** summary changed — fires on session create/join/leave, cart submit, order confirm, item status change (kitchen progress, waiter serve), and any bill-request/generate/revert/pay/free-session. Not scoped per table — every connected waiter/kitchen/cashier/admin screen subscribes to this single shared topic and swaps out just the one tile matching the incoming `tableId`. This is a single global channel, unlike the other topics above which are per-session |

`{sessionId}` in the topic path is the **numeric** `sessionId` field from `SessionResponse`, not the `sessionToken` string. `/topic/tables` has no `{sessionId}`/`{tableId}` in its path — it's one topic for the whole restaurant, and each message payload carries its own `tableId` for the client to match against.

**Reliability requirement**: a subscription does not survive a dropped connection (phone screen lock, backgrounded tab, network blip), and reconnecting does not replay missed messages. Treat WS as a live-update layer on top of REST as the source of truth, not the only source of truth: fetch current state via REST on mount and on every WS reconnect (STOMP's `reconnectDelay` fires an `onConnect` callback on every reconnect, not just the first) and re-subscribe there too, and also reconcile on the browser's `visibilitychange`/`online` events so a backgrounded tab or dropped connection never leaves the UI stuck on stale data.

---

## Seeded data (fresh database)

**Tables** T1–T5, each with a unique `qrToken` — staff can fetch these via `GET /api/admin/tables/roster` now; there's still no endpoint that exposes them to customers, by design.

**Menu**: Starters (Paneer Tikka ₹220, Veg Spring Rolls ₹180), Main Course (Butter Chicken ₹340, Dal Makhani ₹260), Beverages (Masala Chai ₹60, Fresh Lime Soda ₹80). `imageUrl` is currently `null` on all seeded items until Cloudinary URLs are added.

**Staff logins** (password `password123` for all): `waiter1` (WAITER), `kitchen1` (KITCHEN), `cashier1` (CASHIER), `admin1` (ADMIN). Each seeded account also has a sample `email`/`contactNumber`/`address` filled in already (fictional placeholder data, e.g. `waiter1@restropos.example`) — editable by that staff member via `PATCH /api/staff/me` like any other account. `admin1` has **no security PIN set** — call `PATCH /api/admin/me/pin` before exercising `free-session`/`reveal-participants`.

**Customers**: none seeded — the customer table is empty until someone calls `POST /api/customers/login`, which creates a row on first use for any given phone number.
